Learn Right
This game solves the problem of helping young kids (who are still in their formative years )as well as young adults who wish to prepare for their TOEFL or IELTS , learn English the right way !
This game mainly focuses on the concept of Gamification where we offer two main levels
One level offers services for the young ones where we have simple sentences and jumbled up words on platforms . The young one must navigate their woof ( a cute little puppy ) to the right word which form the given sentence . A timer is set to make sure that they are able to locate the right words accurately and quickly . This will not only help their literary skills but also enhance their cognitive and time management skills !
The second level we offer is for the young adults who wish to pursure their higher education abroad or in India by giving them a race against time where we give a word and a bunch of random words are laid out on platforms. The user must select those synonyms which are appropriate for the given word.
A timer ensures a competitive , addictive and a good learning atmosphere for the users.
